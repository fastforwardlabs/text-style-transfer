    "We will formulate parallel Text Style Transfer as Conditional Generation task and fine-tune the `bart-base` pre-trained model on the Wiki Neutrality Corpus in similar fashion to a Summarization use case. More detail on the modeling approach can be [found here](https://www.notion.so/fastforwardlabs/Modeling-Approach-16576e450a2f4237b595acd926d245f5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we intend to modify the exemplar [Huggingface summarization fine-tuning script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/summarization) to fit our use case, model, dataset, and project scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE -** \n",
    "- In order to run the latest version of the example scripts from Hugggingface, you **must install the library from source and install some example-specific requirements**. Details [found here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples#important-note).\n",
    "- In order to get the `scripts/train_job.py` to run as a CML Job, I had to manually run `pip3 install attrs -t /home/cdsw/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages --no-user`. This allowed me to force an install of the newer attrs package into the .local site-packages, which is needed because runtimes come with an older version (attr) that lives in the /usr/lib directory and gets picked up by default -- throwing an error.\n",
