We see that our predicted and target sti distributions are mostly consistent, which suggests the TST model is generally doing its job of neutralizing text to closely resemble that of the ground truth. However, there is a clear difference in the distributions at `STI = 0.00`. Here we see that there are a significant number of generations that result in 0 change in style -- meaning the model simply repeats the input as output. \n",
