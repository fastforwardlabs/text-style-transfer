    "\n",
    "To do so, we'll perform a grid search across different values of each producing a series of experiments. In each experiment, we'll calculate content preservation scores for each ground truth pair in the evalution holdout set -- producing an aggregate content preservation score.\n",

    "**Observations:**\n",
    "- Removal produces consistently higher similarity scores than padding\n",
    "- Style masking in general produces lower similarity scores than the baseline where no tokens are masked\n",
    "- The more tokens we mask, the lower our CPS scores.\n",
    "- Low CPS score outliers from the NO STYLE MASKING experiment highlight records that should probbably be removed from the dataset as they mostly introduce non-NPOV related changes.\n",
    "- Sources of error:\n",
    "    - Classifier isn't well fit. So word attributions are spurious and lead to masking of non-style (aka content) tokens.\n",
    "    - Masking is performed on tokens as split by BERT tokenizer. This means word pieces. May want to implement logic that better combines wordpieces for masking.\n",
    "- We actually have no way of verifying which of these above settings is best. To do so, we would NEED to compare correlations with Human based scores. However, we can draw that conclusion that a low score above means that the meaning of the sentence has changed.\n",
    "- Despite the effectiveness of masking vs. not, this idea of SBERT embeddings as a measure of content preservation between two texts still seems useful.\n",
    "    - For example, if the style transfer leaves out something major or produces something very different, we have a low CPS score -- which is exactly what we want. [267758690]\n",
    "    - Just really hard to say how good/bad this is without comparing results to human evaluation. Maybe need to do this for a different dataset that has human annotations (like from the paper). We should recommend this for future work. This could be a dedicated research cycle, assuming we have access to human annotations."

    "**Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Evaluating / disentangling content preservation is REALLY difficult to do with any precision. (its likely because these things are conflated)\n",
    "1. Our metric tells us if the generated text is wildly different than the input. This is similar to what we can get from BLEU, METEOR.\n",
    "    - SentenceBERT already does a really good job of telling us if two sentences are saying the same thing. We just cant disentangle, with confidence, if difference are because of style or content.\n",
    "    - Whether or not this is \"more correlated\" with human scoring or not, this method does take sentence context into account and BLEU will not. But this method is significantly slower because of BERT inclusion.\n",
    "2. We cannot quantify which is better correlated with content preservation without human scores for preservation. (that other paper shows that it likely isn't significant improvement BLEU / METEOR.\n",
    "3. Failure modes: a.) if classifier isn't fit well b.) masking on tokens that are subwords\n",
